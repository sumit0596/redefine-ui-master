          As with any large organisation, Redefine Properties attracts the
          attention of individuals intent on misusing its name or the names of
          its employees in the pursuit of fraudulent activities from time to
          time.

          Redefine Properties endeavours to highlight any major frauds that it
          is aware of on this website as soon as reasonably possible, but
          unfortunately the increasing volume and type of frauds and scams means
          that it is impossible to prevent the misuse of Redefine Propertiesâ€™
          name and the names of its employees. The most common frauds and scams
          known to us include, but are not limited to, the below:

          and before remitting any funds, please contact the person responsible
          for your account to verify that the bank account you have on record is
